To run these bifurcations, you should have auto-07p installed somewhere on your system, 
and the file structures set for the project as in the Github repository. 
Also, you should run this in Python 2.7 (NOT Python 3.x)

You'll need to have the following Python packages installed as well: 
pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

After that, you should be able to recreate the output files by running 
"execution_and_analysis.py". It will run all subsequent bifurcation analyses 
in the folder. There are instructions in "execution_and_analysis.py" for
running in Windows, but I have not had much luck getting auto to run sucessfully
in that OS; The plotting seems to be especially problematic.
