This was the code used to create the figures for the paper "Non-hierarchical dispersal promotes stability and resilience in a tri-trophic metacommunity" upcoming in American Naturalist

## Running bifurcation analyses
To reproduce the bifurcation analyses from this paper, you have to have python 2.x (2.7+ recommended)
as well as the pandas, numpy and matplotlib packages for python installed. Further, you need to have [auto-07p](http://indy.cs.concordia.ca/auto/) installed somewhere on your system. 

To generate all of the nessecary files for the R-scripts that plot the bifurcation code, you need to run the file "Code/auto_code_for_bifurcation_diagram/execution_and_analysis.py". For further details, see the file "Code/auto_code_for_bifurcation_diagram/instructions for running bifurcations.txt"
